    ## Notes for developers

    ### i18N and Accept-Language header
    All operations will respect Accept-Language headers. If the operation has to handle localizable content it will do so respecting the Accept-Language header. This includes formatting of culture-specific data, sorting, language-specific content (phrases) etc.

    ### Responses
    This specification shows only the most relevant responses. Clients have to still handle all other possible HTTP Response codes.
